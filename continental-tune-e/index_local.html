					Research and Interview
				</h3>
				<p>
					We invited audio engineers to demonstrate us how they are using the current tool in their own context and work environment. We discovered that:
				</p>
				<ul class="list-sp-md">
					<li>
						<p>
							Users might use it under direct sunlight which causes glares from on the screen and reduces the visibility&nbsp;or at night or while driving under different lighting conditions. So, a the colors and text should have great visibility in various environments and should ahve high contrast ratio.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							The laptop can, in many instances, be at some distance from the user which requires the app to have proper visual cues for the user to understand what they are looking, from a distance.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Existing tool uses smaller fonts and condensed layout making the tool cumbersome and difficult to read.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Current tool does not ask for confirmation from user for any action, potentially leading to catastrophic results if a wrong action is selected and critical conditions.

					Ideate and Design
				</h3>
				<p class="p-bloc-75-style">
					Before I joined the team at DePaul Innovation Development Laboratory, the former UX Designer already had a overhauled version of the Tune-E which looked and worked amazing as compared to the existing tool that Continental was used. The user experience had clearly started to shape-up.
				</p>
				<p>
					I focused my work on refining the design more and tested the design against these design principles:
				</p>
				<ul class="list-sp-md">
					<li>
						<p class="float-lg-none">
							<b>Consistency:</b> Create a coherent and cohesive experience throughout the tool so that if user uses one part of the tool and moves over to the next, it looks and behaves the same way.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<b>Usefulness:</b> Make the tool more usable by providing the context-aware content to the user and hide all the non-important and non-relevant things from the screen so that the user can focus on the task at hand.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<b>Communication:</b> Provide easy to find and easy to understand visual cues to the user and provide appropriate, clear and timely feedback to the user so that user is always informed of what is happening of his actions on the screen.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<b>Simplicity:</b> Reduce clutter and remove all the unnecessary items from the screen so that it decreases the cognitive load and increases the focus of the user on the task at hand.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<b>Error Prevention and Handling:</b> Ask for confirmation before allowing any potentially destructive actions of the user to help prevent any catastrophic consequences in critial situations.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<b>Efficiency:</b> Accomodate both new and experienced users to help them reach the same level of efficiency and expertise level by easing the way things are done in the tool.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<b>Work Load Reduction:</b> Use all above design principles to make user&rsquo;s work easier, simpler, faster and efficient.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					This is one of the rough sketches I used to generate ideas on how to proceed with the project. I designed numerous similar sketches as part of brainstorming. Even though none of the brainstorming sketches share a resemblance to the actual project, they were very crucial in giving me the direction to proceed with the actual design.

					Design Iterations
				</h4>
				<p class="mg-lg p-166-style">
					When I joined this project at DePaul iD Lab, the tool was already going through it&rsquo;s eighth iteration of design and was starting to look and behave much better. I took on the role to refine the interface much further and did the following changes:
				</p>
				<ul class="list-sp-md">
					<li>
						<p>
							<b>Visual enhancement:</b> Enhanced the interface design to make it more visually appealing.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<b>Color Contrast enhancement:</b> I tested few variations of the main color schemes to improve the color contrast throughout the tool to improve the visibility of UI elements in varying lighting environments.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<b>Simplyfying Iconography:</b> I redesigned 90% of the icons to better align them with the functionality of the addociated feature in the tool. These icons were later tested in the usability test to lean how engineers interpret them.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<b>Reducing space wastage:</b> With improved visual design and confident iconography, I was able to reduce the amount of space used by each UI element on the screen, still keeping the font size and icons size exactly same as before.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<b>Reclaiming space:</b>&nbsp;More screen space was reclaimed by removing the text labels and putting them as either tooltips or expandable sidebar since the usability test indicated that all the engineers were able to easily understand the meanings of icons correctly without any given context.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<b>UX Copyrighting:</b> UX Copy was one very important part of the entire redesign. Text everywhere was rewritten, wherever required, to make it easier for the user to understand what is going on, what they hae to do and what will be the potential outcome of their actions.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="p-173-style">
					We initially tested out all the abovementioned changes in few of the screens to test the effect of change on engineers and after finding out that te changes are helping them improve the way they interact with the tool, we updated rest of the screens and used that design to create new screen and features for the tool.

					Designing the Style Guide
				</h4>
				<p class="p-bloc-78-style">
					Working on such a big project with so many features, it was crucial to have a Design System that both Designers and Developers can use. When I started working on this project, it did not have a design system. So, once I tested the new iteration I designed, I meticulously crafted the components for the design system such as buttons, colors, icons, and even different states for each component. All of those components came in handy throughout the course of the project not just for me and my fellow UX Designer but also for the developers. With the help of design system we were able to reduce the burden of going back-and-forth in previous screens to refer back for the specifications of UI elements and also reduce the time taken to design each screen. Also, were were able to streamline the development process by providing them with the design assets and specifications for each UI element.

					Logics + Communication
				</h4>
				<p class="mg-lg p-bloc-77-style">
					It is very important to have correct functionality bound to correct button. Each UI element has a behavior connected to it and that behavior should mimic the mental model of the user. That is specially important when working in multi-page forms. While creating the interactions, I made sure that the tool is flexible enough to avoid any eoor conditions and accommodate more functionality with less clutter. And, once I designed the interaction, it was very important to communicate that to the developers. This image is one of the many such screensots I sent to the developers to provide them a visual aid for the intended interactions to be made.

					Test, Validate and Fix
				</h3>
				<p class="p-bloc-76-style">
					We did 4 usability studies during the course of the project. I spearheaded the Usability studies to make sure we maintain high standards of moderation and homogenity of testing environment. I helped my fellow UX Designer in creating the test script and task list for the usability studies. Before every test session we tested the prototypes on different screens and operating system versions of Windows to make sure we can provide the most realistic environment to the participants. All the tests happened in the simulated lab environment. In each study session, we tested the prototypes with 5 engineers. We allowed them to initially get familiar with the prototype and informed them of the limitations of the interactivity and realism. Then we gave them tasks to accomplish with various features of the tool. At the end of each usability study, we asked the engineers for their feedback to get deeper insights about their work style. Then we implemented the necessary changes in our design and development.

					<strong>Final Product</strong>
				</h2>
				<p class="mg-lg p-177-style">
					The final product is a Windows application that is currently being tested by Continental&rsquo;s engineers before releasing it to their business partners and individual customers. The design guidelines I created will be used by their team to design features for future releases. The tool is the perfect balance between Beauty and Functionality. On one hand, it helps the engineers quickly do what they do everyday, on the other hand, new users will be able to learn how to use this tool by the easy to learn onboarding feature. One of the biggest challenge of this project was to use the legacy technology to create modern visual elements with it, to make the product both backward and forward compatible i.e. this tool is developed using C# Winforms with every element custom made to cater users of both Windows 7 and Windows 10 without any aesthetically changes.
				</p>
				<h2 class="mg-md">
					<strong>Achievements</strong>
				</h2>
				<p>
					We achieved high level of UX standards on this project by following the user-centered design process and UX principles. With the accomplishment of this project, we achieved the following things:
				</p>
				<ul class="list-sp-md">
					<li>
						<p>
							Improve the aesthetic appeal of the tool to cater it better toward Continental&rsquo;s business partners and customers.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Deliver high standards of user experience in the tool by making it easy to use, easy to learn and faster to complete tasks, based on our usability test results.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Improve the efficiency of the engineers by 2x thereby also increasing efficiency of tool.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Reduce the error rate occurance in the tool by more than 50% by following the UX principles and our creative problem solving ability.
